# Eclipse Kanto

The Eclipse Kanto project brings cloud-native technologies like containerization
and control planes at the edge, to seamlessly manage diverse software on
constrained edge devices like vehicle computers, connected building gateways,
connected appliance and equipment, machines and more.

Eclipse Kanto is implemented in Go to naturally integrate with existing
technologies, frameworks and ecosystems, meet footprint and (near) real-time
constraints, leverage modern development toolchains and ensure optimal learning
curve for IoT and open source developers. As Eclipse Kanto is modular by nature,
new components can also be implemented in other languages like Rust, C/C++
depending on the use cases and problems they solve. Whatever the language,
everyone is more than welcome onboard to learn, collaborate and contribute on
each and every step on the way forward.
