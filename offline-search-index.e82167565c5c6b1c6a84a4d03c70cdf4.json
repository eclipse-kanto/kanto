It provides the following use cases:\nEnriched remote connection Optimized - to pass the messages via a single underlying connection Secured - to protect the edge identity and data via TLS with basic and certificate-based authentication Maintained - with a reconnect exponential backoff algorithm Synchronized - on a connectivity recovering via a message buffering Application protection - suite connector is the only one component with a remote connectivity i.e. all local applications are protected from exposure to the public network Offline mode - local applications don’t need to care about the status of the remote connection, they can stay fully operable in offline mode How it works The suite connector plays a key role in two communication aspects - local and remote.\nCloud connectivity To initiate its connection, the edge has to be manually or automatically provisioned. The result of this operation is different parameters and identifiers. Currently, suite connector supports MQTT transport as a connection-oriented and requiring less resources in comparison to AMQP. Once established, the connection is used as a channel to pass the edge telemetry and event messages. The IoT cloud can control the edge via commands and responses.\nIn case of a connection interruption, the suite connector will switch to offline mode. The message buffer mechanism will be activated to ensure that there is no data loss. Reconnect exponential backoff algorithm will be started to guarantee that no excessive load will be generated to the IoT cloud. All local applications are not affected and can continue to operate as normal. Once the remote connection is restored, all buffered messages will be sent and the edge will be fully restored to online mode.\nLocal communication Ensuring that local applications are loosely coupled, Eclipse Hono™ MQTT definitions are in use. The event-driven local messages exchange is done via a MQTT message broker - Eclipse Mosquitto™. The suite connector takes the responsibility to forward these messages to the IoT cloud and vice versa.\nThe provisioning information used to establish the remote communication is available locally both on request via a predefined message and on update populated via an announcement. Applications that would like to extend the edge functionality can further use it in Eclipse Hono™ and Eclipse Ditto™ definitions.\nMonitoring of the remote connection status is also enabled locally as well, along with details like the last known state of the connection, timestamp and a predefined connect/disconnect reason.\n","categories":"","description":"Empower the edge device with a remote connectivity.\n","excerpt":"Empower the edge device with a remote connectivity.\n","ref":"/kanto/docs/concepts/suite-connector/","tags":"","title":"Suite connector"},{"body":"Properties To control all aspects of the suite connector behavior.\nProperty Type Default Description provisioningFile string ​ provisioning.json Path to the provisioning file, if Bosch IoT Device Management is in use Remote connectivity address string mqtts://mqtt.bosch-iot-hub.com:8883 Address of the MQTT endpoint that the suite connector will connect for the remote communication, the format is: scheme://host:port deviceId string Device unique identifier authId string Authentication unique identifier that is a part of the credentials tenantId string Tenant unique identifier that the device belongs to password string Password that is a part of the credentials clientId string MQTT client unique identifier policyId string Policy unique identifier of the digital twin Remote connectivity - TLS cacert string iothub.crt PEM encoded CA certificates file cert string PEM encoded certificate file to authenticate to the MQTT endpoint key string PEM encoded unencrypted private key file to authenticate to the MQTT endpoint deviceIdPattern string Pattern to generate the device identifier, {{subject-dn}} and {{subject-cn}} placeholders can be part of it Remote connectivity - TLS over TPM tpmDevice string Path to the device file or the unix socket to access the TPM 2.0 tpmHandle int TPM 2.0 storage root key handle, the type is unsigned 64-bit integer tpmKeyPub string File path to the public part of the TPM 2.0 key tpmKey string File path to the private part of the TPM 2.0 key Local connectivity localAddress string tcp://localhost:1883 Address of the MQTT server/broker that the suite connector will connect for the local communication, the format is: scheme://host:port localUsername string Username that is a part of the credentials localPassword string Password that is a part of the credentials Logging logFile string log/suite-connector.log Path to the file where log messages are written logLevel string INFO All log messages at this or higher level will be logged, the log levels in descending order are: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG and TRACE logFileCount int 5 Log file maximum rotations count logFileMaxAge int 28 Log file rotations maximum age in days, use 0 to not remove old log files logFileSize int 2 Log file size in MB before it gets rotated Example The minimal required configuration to connect the publicly available Eclipse Hono sandbox.\n{ \"address\":\"hono.eclipseprojects.io:1883\", \"cacert\": \"/etc/suite-connector/iothub.crt\", \"tenantId\": \"org.eclipse.kanto\", \"deviceId\": \"org.eclipse.kanto:exampleDevice\", \"authId\": \"org.eclipse.kanto_example\", \"password\": \"secret\", \"logFile\": \"/var/log/suite-connector/suite-connector.log\" } Template The configuration can be further adjusted according to the use case.
