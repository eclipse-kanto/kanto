### Example

The minimal required configuration to connect.

```json
{
    "connectionString": "HostName=hostName.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=deviceId;SharedAccessKey=cGFzc3AvcKQ=",
    "caCert": "/etc/azure-connector/iothub.crt",
    "logFile": "/var/log/azure-connector/azure-connector.log"
}
```

### Template

The configuration can be further adjusted according to the use case.
The following template illustrates all possible properties with their default values.
