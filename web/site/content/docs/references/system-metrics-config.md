### Example

The minimal required configuration that enables the auto reporting of system metrics.

```json
{
    "frequency": "60s",
    "logFile": "/var/log/system-metrics/system-metrics.log"
}
```

### Template

The configuration can be further adjusted according to the use case.
The following template illustrates all possible properties with their default values.

```json
{
    "frequency" : "",
    "broker": "tcp://localhost:1883",
    "username": "",
    "password": "",
    "caCert": "",
    "clientCert": "",
    "cleintKey": "",
    "logFile": "log/system-metrics.log",
    "logLevel": "INFO",
    "logFileCount": 5,
    "logFileMaxAge": 28,
    "logFileSize": 2
}
```
