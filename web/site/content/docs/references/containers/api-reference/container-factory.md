If the IP of the host machine is to be added to the container's hosts file the reserved host_ip[_<network-interface>] must be provided. If only host_ip (the network-interface part is skipped) is used, by default it will be resolved to the host's IP on the default bridge network interface for containerm (the default configuration is kanto-cm0) and add it to the container's hosts file. If the IP of a container in the same bridge network is to be added to the hosts file the reserved container_<container-host_name> must be provided. |

> | maxRetryCount | | Maximum number of retries that are made to restart the container on exit with fail, if the `type` is on-failure |
> | retryTimeout | | Timeout period in seconds for each retry that is made to restart the container on exit with fail, if the `type` is on-failure |
> | **portMappings** | | An array of port mappings from the host to a container |

> | rootDir | <meta_path>/containers/<container_id> | Root directory where the container's log messages are stored |
> | mode | blocking | Messaging delivery mode from the container to the log driver, the supported modes are: blocking and non-blocking |
> | maxBufferSize | 1M | Maximum size of the buffered container's log messages in a non-blocking mode as a number with a unit suffix of B, K, M and G |
> | **resources** | | |
> | memory | | Hard memory limitation of the container as a number with a unit suffix of B, K, M and G, the minimum allowed value is 3M |
> | memoryReservation | | Soft memory limitation of the container as a number with a unit suffix of B, K, M and G, if `memory` is specified, the `memoryReservation` must be smaller than it |
> | memorySwap | | Total amount of memory and swap that the container can use as a number with a unit suffix of B, K, M and G, use -1 to allow the container to use unlimited swap |
